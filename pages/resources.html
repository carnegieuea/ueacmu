              Your project is on the track right now. It's time to raise some
              funds. As an undergraduate student, your the best way to raise
              funds may be joining pitch competitions.<br /><br />

              In pitch competitions, you normally have 3-6 mins to pitch your
              idea to a panel of investors. Some of the best pitch competitions
              for undergrads on campus are our very own
              <a href="../404.html">CMU Venture Challenge</a> and
              <a

              >
              .<br /><br />
              In our CMU VC, you will compete with other undergrad start-ups
              across the country, whereas in McGinnis Venture Competition you
              compete with other CMU teams including maters and PhDs. Definitely
              join both if you want to gain more experience!
